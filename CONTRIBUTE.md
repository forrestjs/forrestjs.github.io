# Contribute to the ForrestJS Gitbook

This documentation project is a living thing. We are just moving our first steps.

You can run the book on your machine like this:

    yarn && yarn book

This will create a development distribution to:

    http://localhost:4000

Feel free to hack into our documentation, fix typos, add links to relevant resources
or referenced projects and then PR back your contribution.
