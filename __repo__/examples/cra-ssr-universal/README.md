# @marcopeg/react-ssr - frontend example

This code represents the frontent example that is covered in the documentation
of [@marcopeg/react-ssr](https://marcopeg.github.io/react-ssr).

This is the full ssr boilerplate, our simple app will be first rendered in the
backend by NodeJS, and then it will continue working in the frontend with React!

> (there is a spinning svg that proves beyond any reasonable doubt that it works)

    npm install
    npm run start:prod
